            <div class="collapsible-content">
                [cite_start]<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of AI on undergraduate students, examining whether AI fosters academic and personal growth or acts as a barrier to development[cite: 3]. [cite_start]A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining survey questionnaires and focus group discussions[cite: 5]. [cite_start]A sample of 253 undergraduate students from across India were surveyed[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The findings provide empirical insights into AI's dual role in education, informing policy recommendations for responsible AI integration in academic settings[cite: 12].</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative domain within computer science that aims to simulate human intelligence processes through machines[cite: 17]. [cite_start]College students now commonly utilize AI-based tools such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, and others for academic tasks[cite: 24]. [cite_start]This study explores the psychological impact of this integration, categorizing the effects into positive facilitators (Cognitive Enhancement, Productivity, Skill Development, and Well-being) and negative barriers (Cognitive Overreliance, Ethical Concerns, Stress, and Social Deficits)[cite: 48, 49, 50, 59].</p>
        </section>

        <section id="methods">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>The study utilized a mixed-methods design with a sample of 253 undergraduate students from various universities across India[cite: 118, 120]. [cite_start]Data was collected using two self-constructed 5-point Likert-scale questionnaires measuring AI usage and psychological impact[cite: 134]. [cite_start]A Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with 13 participants provided qualitative insights[cite: 141]. [cite_start]The data was analyzed using one-way and two-way ANOVA, t-tests, and thematic analysis[cite: 9, 11, 170].</p>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>The quantitative analysis revealed significant differences in psychological impact across AI usage groups (High, Moderate, Low, and Control)[cite: 172, 210]. [cite_start]High AI users reported significantly greater positive psychological effects and lower negative impacts compared to other groups[cite: 362]. [cite_start]No significant gender-based differences were found in either positive or negative impacts[cite: 416, 464].</p>

            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>The findings suggest that students who are more familiar with AI tools perceive them as enhancers rather than threats, aligning with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)[cite: 363, 364]. [cite_start]High AI usage was correlated with increased cognitive enhancement, productivity, and psychological well-being[cite: 369, 374, 380]. [cite_start]Conversely, lower usage was associated with higher stress and ethical concerns[cite: 394, 399]. [cite_start]Qualitative data from the FGD revealed themes of dependency ("Pehle books kholte the...ab seedha ChatGPT"), ethical ambiguity, and a demand for formal AI education in curricula[cite: 230, 422, 425].</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>This study concludes that while AI can be a powerful academic and psychological facilitator, its benefits are closely tied to the user's familiarity, access, and critical engagement[cite: 503]. [cite_start]Without structured education and ethical guidelines, AI risks becoming a tool of dependency rather than empowerment[cite: 504]. [cite_start]Educational institutions must adopt comprehensive AI literacy programs to ensure students are equipped to use AI responsibly and effectively[cite: 505].</p>
